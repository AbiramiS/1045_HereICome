6. About (Short Description / Summary):

	The aim of this project is to alert the user about a meeting, using an alarm and send user location as text message to the person to be met, in specific time intervals. The application uses a map for detecting user location and checking the destination location. This avoids unnecessary texting while driving and helps in improving road safety. Mobile phones have become a popular consumer product and a simple system that mutually benefits both the user and the person to be met, makes the process easier with the help of network and GPS technology.
	There are three modules in this project, which are processing makes the location based alerting system an efficient and flexible application. Here the modules processed are working and performing tasks in easiest way. The followings are the modules of the project.
	* SMS Sending Module
	* Alarm Module
	* Maps Module
SMS module gets the phone number as input from the user and sends the current location of the user to that phone number using network carrier. Alarm module is used to call the in-built alarm clock for setting time for the event. Maps module is used to select the destination location and get directions to that location from the user’s current location. The map helps the user in giving location input and getting directions, thereby serving both purposes effectively.
